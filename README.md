# svd_image_compression
[Singular Value Decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) of matrices has a large range of applications. Image processing is part of it. <br>
I propose you to test various compression rates on the famous image of lena and see what it gives.

> [!NOTE]
> As usual, Numpy and Matplotlib required.
